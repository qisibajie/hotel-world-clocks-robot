Documentation   Use Robot Framework Maven Plugin and Java to implement the
...             Hotel World Clocks kata and refactor it to Observer design
...             pattern. In this kata, a hotel has 5 clocks showing the time
...             of Beijing (UTC+8), London (UTC+0), Moscow (UTC+4), Sydney
...             (UTC+10), and New York (UTC-5). You have to consider daylight
...             saving time (DST) for cities like London and New York in this kata.
...             When the time of each one of these clocks is set due to
...             incorrect time or start/end of daylight saving period, the time
...             of all other clocks will be set automatically. The hotel would
...             add more clocks for different cities in the future.

*** Test Cases ***
Adjust the incorrect time of Beijing
    Given a hotel lobby has five clocks
    And "London" is in the DST period
    And "New York" is in the DST period
    And "Beijing" does not use the DST
    And "Moscow" does not use the DST
    And "Sydney" does not use the DST
    When I adjust the incorrect time of the clock of "Beijing" to be 9
    Then the time of the clock of "Beijing" should be 9
    And the time of the clock of "London" should be 2
    And the time of the clock of "Moscow" should be 5
    And the time of the clock of "Sydney" should be 11
    And the time of the clock of "New York" should be 21

The daylight saving period of London ends
    Given a hotel lobby has five clocks
    And the DST period of "London" ends
    And the DST period of "New York" does not end
    And "Beijing" does not use the DST
    And "Moscow" does not use the DST
    And "Sydney" does not use the DST
    When I adjust the time of the clock of "London" to be 0 due to the end of DST
    Then the time of the clock of "Beijing" should be 8
    And the time of the clock of "London" should be 0
    And the time of the clock of "Moscow" should be 4
    And the time of the clock of "Sydney" should be 10
    And the time of the clock of "New York" should be 20
